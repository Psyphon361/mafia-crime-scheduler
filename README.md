### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Install Foundry

Foundry is used to interact with the smart contract.

#### Windows: Set Up WSL First
Windows users need to use Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) because Foundry works best in a Linux environment.
1. **Enable the WSL Feature on Windows**:
   - Open **Control Panel** ‚Üí **Programs** ‚Üí **Turn Windows features on or off**.
   - Scroll down and check the box for **Windows Subsystem for Linux**.
   - Click **OK** and restart your computer when prompted.
2. Install WSL:
   - Open a Command Prompt as Administrator (right-click Command Prompt and select "Run as administrator").
   - Run:
     ```bash
     wsl --install
     ```
   - This installs WSL and Ubuntu (a Linux distribution). Restart your computer if prompted.
3. After restarting, open "Ubuntu" from the Start menu. It will set up Ubuntu and ask you to create a username and password.
4. Install Foundry in WSL:
   - Open your Ubuntu terminal (from the Start menu).
   - Install Foundry:
     ```bash
     curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
     ```

## üîê Secure Your Private Keys with Foundry‚Äôs Keystore

To keep your private keys safe, we‚Äôll use Foundry‚Äôs `cast wallet import` to encrypt them with a password. This is a critical security step! üîê

### Why This Is Important

Storing your private key in plain text (e.g., in the `.env` file) is dangerous. If someone accesses your computer, they can steal your funds. Using `cast wallet import`, your private key is encrypted and stored securely on your computer, protected by a password. Only you can decrypt it with the password.

### Steps to Encrypt Your Private Key

#### Import Your PulseChain Private Key:
Run:
```bash
cast wallet import <KEYSTORE_NAME> --interactive
```
You‚Äôll be prompted to enter your private key (without the `0x` prefix) and a password. Choose a strong password (e.g., at least 12 characters, mix of letters, numbers, and symbols). Write it down and store it securely (e.g., in a password manager or on paper in a safe place).

**Example:**
```text
Enter private key: <your-private-key>
Enter password: <your-strong-password>
```
This creates an encrypted keystore file in `~/.foundry/keystores/`.

#### Import Your BNB Chain Private Key:
If you‚Äôre using a different private key for BNB Chain, repeat the process with a different name:
```bash
cast wallet import <BNB_KEYSTORE_NAME> --interactive
```
If you‚Äôre using the same private key for both chains, you can skip this step and use the same keystore name for both.

## üìù Create the `.env` File

The `.env` file stores your configuration settings. Let‚Äôs create it.

### Create the File:
In the `mafia-crime-scheduler` directory, create a file named `.env`:

- **Windows (WSL)/Linux/macOS:** Use a text editor like nano:
  ```bash
  nano .env
  ```
  Or create it manually in your file explorer.

### Add the Following Content:
Copy and paste this into your `.env` file, replacing the placeholders with your values:

```text
PLS_RPC_URL=https://rpc-pulsechain.g4mm4.io
BNB_RPC_URL=https://bsc-dataseed.bnbchain.org
PLS_KEYSTORE_NAME=<your-pls-keystore-name>
BNB_KEYSTORE_NAME=<your-bnb-keystore-name>
PLS_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD=<your-pls-keystore-password>
BNB_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD=<your-bnb-keystore-password>
CHAIN_CHOICE=2  # 0 -> PLS, 1 -> BNB, 2 -> BOTH
PLS_CRIME_TYPE=0  # 0 -> ROB_A_HOT_DOG_VENDOR, 1 -> ROB_A_FREIGHT_TRAIN, 2 -> ROB_THE_BANK, 3 -> BRIBE_THE_POLICE_STATION
BNB_CRIME_TYPE=0  # 0 -> ROB_A_HOT_DOG_VENDOR, 1 -> ROB_A_FREIGHT_TRAIN, 2 -> ROB_THE_BANK, 3 -> BRIBE_THE_POLICE_STATION
```

### Explanation:
- `PLS_RPC_URL`: The PulseChain RPC URL (default provided).
- `BNB_RPC_URL`: The BNB Chain RPC URL (default provided).
- `PLS_KEYSTORE_NAME`: The name of your PulseChain keystore (e.g., `LAURENTIS`).
- `BNB_KEYSTORE_NAME`: The name of your BNB Chain keystore (e.g., `LAURENTIS` or `LAURENTIS_BNB`).
- `PLS_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD`: The password you set for your PulseChain keystore.
- `BNB_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD`: The password you set for your BNB Chain keystore.
- `CHAIN_CHOICE`: Choose which chain(s) to run:
  - `0`: PulseChain only
  - `1`: BNBChain only
  - `2`: Both chains
- `PLS_CRIME_TYPE`: The type of crime to commit on PulseChain (default is `0` for `ROB_A_HOT_DOG_VENDOR`):
  - `0`: `ROB_A_HOT_DOG_VENDOR`
  - `1`: `ROB_A_FREIGHT_TRAIN`
  - `2`: `ROB_THE_BANK`
  - `3`: `BRIBE_THE_POLICE_STATION`
- `BNB_CRIME_TYPE`: The type of crime to commit on BNB Chain (default is `0` for `ROB_A_HOT_DOG_VENDOR`):
  - `0`: `ROB_A_HOT_DOG_VENDOR`
  - `1`: `ROB_A_FREIGHT_TRAIN`
  - `2`: `ROB_THE_BANK`
  - `3`: `BRIBE_THE_POLICE_STATION`

## üì§ Using Multiple Wallets

To manage multiple wallets, you can specify a comma-separated list of keystore names and their corresponding passwords in the `.env` file. The script will execute the `makeCrime` function for each wallet sequentially based on the `CHAIN_CHOICE` setting.

### How to Configure
- Update the following variables in your `.env` file with comma-separated values:
  - `PLS_KEYSTORE_NAME`: List of keystore names for PulseChain.
  - `BNB_KEYSTORE_NAME`: List of keystore names for BNB Chain.
  - `PLS_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD`: List of passwords corresponding to the PulseChain keystore names.
  - `BNB_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD`: List of passwords corresponding to the BNB Chain keystore names.
- Ensure the order of names and passwords matches (e.g., the first name pairs with the first password).

### Example
```plaintext
PLS_KEYSTORE_NAME=LAURENTIS,VALENTINI,ROSSI
BNB_KEYSTORE_NAME=LAURENTIS,VALENTINI,ROSSI
PLS_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD=laurentis,valentini,rossi
BNB_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD=laurentis,valentini,rossi
CHAIN_CHOICE=2
PLS_CRIME_TYPE=0
BNB_CRIME_TYPE=0
```

### Save and Exit:
If using nano, press `Ctrl+O`, then `Enter` to save, and `Ctrl+X` to exit.

Now you‚Äôre ready to run the scheduler!

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Test the Script

Run the script to ensure everything works:
```bash
node run-crime-scriptV1.js
```

You should see logs like:
```text
Starting scheduler at 2025-05-16T14:30:00.000Z
Scheduler started with fixed 16-minute intervals (15 minutes + 1 minute buffer).
PLS makeCrime (crimeType: 0) executed successfully for LAURENTIS
PLS next run for LAURENTIS scheduled for 2025-05-16T14:46:00.000Z (in 16 minutes)
BNB makeCrime (crimeType: 0) executed successfully for LAURENTIS
BNB next run for LAURENTIS scheduled for 2025-05-16T14:46:00.000Z (in 16 minutes)
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Run in the Background with pm2

Start the script with pm2:
```bash
pm2 start run-crime-scriptV1.js
```

Save the pm2 process to ensure it runs on system startup:
```bash
pm2 save
```

View the logs to confirm it‚Äôs running:
```bash
pm2 logs run-crime-scriptV1
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Updating Configuration

If you change the `.env` file (e.g., switch `CHAIN_CHOICE`), restart the pm2 process to apply the changes:
```bash
pm2 restart run-crime-scriptV1
```

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Updating the Submodule

If the `foundry-crime-scripts` submodule has been updated, run the following to get the latest changes:
```bash
cd foundry-crime-scripts
git pull origin main
cd ..
git submodule update --init --recursive
```
Then restart the pm2 process:
```bash
pm2 restart run-crime-scriptV1
```

## üîí Best Security Practices

Security is critical when dealing with private keys and blockchain transactions. Follow these practices to stay safe:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Protect Your Private Keys
- **Never Share Your Private Key:** Your private key gives full access to your funds. Never share it with anyone, including the project maintainers.
- **Use Foundry‚Äôs Keystore:** By using `cast wallet import`, your private key is encrypted and stored securely. Only the password can decrypt it.
- **Choose a Strong Password:** Use a password that‚Äôs at least 12 characters long, with a mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols (e.g., `MySecurePass123!`).
- **Store Passwords Safely:** Write down your keystore password and store it in a secure place (e.g., a password manager like LastPass or a physical safe). Don‚Äôt store it on your computer in plain text.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Secure Your `.env` File
- **Don‚Äôt Commit `.env` to Git:** The `.env` file contains sensitive data (like your keystore passwords). It‚Äôs already in `.gitignore`, so it won‚Äôt be committed to GitHub.
- **Restrict File Permissions:**
  - **Linux/macOS:** Run:
    ```bash
    chmod 600 .env
    ```
  - **Windows (WSL):** The above command works in WSL. On Windows itself, right-click the `.env` file, go to **Properties > Security**, and ensure only your user account has access.
- **Backup Your `.env` File:** Copy it to a secure location (e.g., an encrypted USB drive) in case you lose it.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ General Security Tips
- **Keep Your System Secure:** Ensure your computer is protected with antivirus software and a firewall.
- **Use a Dedicated Account:** Consider using a separate wallet with a small amount of funds for this project, rather than your main wallet.
- **Monitor Logs:** Regularly check `pm2 logs run-crime-scriptV1` for errors or unexpected behavior.
- **Update Dependencies:** Keep Node.js, Foundry, and pm2 up to date to avoid security vulnerabilities:
  ```bash
  npm install -g npm
  foundryup
  npm install -g pm2
  ```

---

## üöß Troubleshooting

### Error: "forge: command not found":
- Ensure Foundry is installed (see the "Install Foundry" section).
- Run `foundryup` again.

### Error: "node: command not found":
- Ensure Node.js is installed (see the "Install Node.js" section).

### Transaction Reverts:
- This might be due to a cooldown period or jailing in the smart contract. The script will retry after 16 minutes, but you can check the contract logic if you have access.

### Logs Not Showing:
- Ensure pm2 is running:
  ```bash
  pm2 list
  ```
- View logs:
  ```bash
  pm2 logs run-crime-scriptV1
  ```

### Submodule Not Found:
- If you cloned the repo without submodules, initialize them:
  ```bash
  git submodule update --init --recursive
  ```
